# Todo App
Todo App is a simple React web application that allows users to manage their todo list. Users can add, edit, and remove items from the list. 
Each item can have a status, which can be updated as "Pending" or "Completed". The app also uses LocalStorage to save the todo list data, so the added items will be 
persisted even after page reloads.

# Technologies Used
